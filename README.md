 ## Creating a Portfolio Website 2.

 # Welcome!

 Thankyou for checking this piece of work. 

 ##ABOUT THIS WORK:
This work is done for the basic practise of html, css and java-script. I used html(Hypertext mark-up language) for the structure of the design, and css(cascading style sheet) for implementing design and additional layouts for the already inserted html mark-up., and i used js(java-script) for the insertion of nav-bar functions.

   ## My Challanges and lessons
  Learnt how to display elements with proper grid systems and making them responsive on mobile view, and also the nav-bar functioned by js was quite interseting with little          defects at the beginning due to wrong assignment of classes to the functions.
